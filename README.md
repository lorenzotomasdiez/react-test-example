Each task in the exam should meet the basic requirements and specific job-related skills. Candidates should demonstrate their ability to go beyond the basics and continue to escalate their skills and knowledge, which may include understanding and applying advanced concepts, effectively solving complex problems, and improving existing processes. Additionally, it's important for candidates to demonstrate their ability to organize and structure their code effectively, following industry best practices and patterns. Ultimately, the ability to create a well-organized and maintainable codebase is a critical skill for any developer and should be demonstrated throughout the exam.
